# Chaos-Analyses
Includes Phase Portraits, Bifurcation Diagrams, Lyapunov Exponent, PSD

  
The project design can be found on my webpage at "samsilvauor.github.com".  
The data comes from the circuit mentioned in the paper.  
You can run the code theoretically since the diffeq is given in program.
Just create syntentic data with the equation.
